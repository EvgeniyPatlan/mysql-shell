   * - Use the metadata to define custom validators

   * using camelCase in JavaScript and snake_case in Python.
   *
   * The function definition may contain the following options:
   *
   * - brief: brief description of the function being registered.
   * - details: array of strings with details about the function being
   *   registered. Each entry on this list is turned into a paragraph
   *   in the help system.
   * - parameters: list of parameters that the function accepts.
   *
   * Each parameter is defined as another dictionary where the following options
   * are allowed:
   * - name: required, the name of the parameter.
   * - type: required, the parameter data type.
   * - required: boolean indicating if the parameter is required or not.
   * - brief: brief description of the parameter.
   * - details: list of strings with additional details about the parameter.

   * - string
   * - integer
   * - float
   * - bool
   * - array
   * - dictionary
   * - object

   * the class that the object must be. Also may include a 'classes' option
   * with a list of allowed object types.
   *
   * A dictionary parameter must include an 'options' option which is a list
   * of options allowed on the parameter.

   * The definition of each option follows the same rules as the definition
