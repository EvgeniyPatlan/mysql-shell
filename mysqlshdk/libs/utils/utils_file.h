/**
 * Calculate a temporary file path based on a given file_path.

 * This function determines the path for a temporary file to use. The
 * temporary cannot exist. First, a simple '.tmp' extension is appended to the
 * provided file, if that file already  exists it tries to also appends a
 * random generated integer to the extension (e.g., tmp123456). After 5
 * attempts, using a random number in the file name, if they all exist an
 * error is issued.
 *
 * This function is used by the write() function, since any new configuration
 * file is first wrote to a temporary file and only at the end copied/renamed
 * to the target location if no errors occurred. This avoids undesired
 * changes to the target file in case it already exist and an error occured
 * during the write operation.
 *
 * @param file_path string with the path to the target on which the temporary
 * path will be based upon.
 * @return string with the path of the temporary file to use.
 * @throw std::runtime_error if the function fails to generate a non-existing
 *        temporary file (after 5 attempts using random numbers in the file
 *        name).
