WHERE
      expressionStr: The expression to be represented by the object

DESCRIPTION
      An expression object is required in many operations on the X DevAPI.

      Some applications of the expression objects include:

      - Creation of documents based on a JSON string

      - Defining calculated fields when pulling data from the database

#@<OUT> mysqlx.get_session
NAME
      get_session - Creates a Session instance using the provided connection

DESCRIPTION
      A Session object uses the X Protocol to allow executing operations on the
      connected MySQL Server.

      The connection data may be specified in the following formats:

      - A URI string
      - A dictionary with the connection options

      A basic URI string has the following format:

      [scheme://][user[:password]@]<host[:port]|socket>[/schema][?option=value&option=value...]

      SSL Connection Options

      The following options are valid for use either in a URI or in a
      dictionary:

      - ssl-mode: the SSL mode to be used in the connection.
      - ssl-ca: the path to the X509 certificate authority in PEM format.
      - ssl-capath: the path to the directory that contains the X509
        certificates authorities in PEM format.
      - ssl-cert: The path to the X509 certificate in PEM format.
      - ssl-key: The path to the X509 key in PEM format.
      - ssl-crl: The path to file that contains certificate revocation lists.
      - ssl-crlpath: The path of directory that contains certificate revocation
        list files.
      - ssl-cipher: SSL Cipher to use.
      - tls-version: List of protocols permitted for secure connections
      - auth-method: Authentication method
      - get-server-public-key: Request public key from the server required for
        RSA key pair-based password exchange. Use when connecting to MySQL 8.0
        servers with classic MySQL sessions with SSL mode DISABLED.
      - server-public-key-path: The path name to a file containing a
        client-side copy of the public key required by the server for RSA key
        pair-based password exchange. Use when connecting to MySQL 8.0 servers
        with classic MySQL sessions with SSL mode DISABLED.

      When these options are defined in a URI, their values must be URL
      encoded.

      The following options are also valid when a dictionary is used:

      Base Connection Options

      - scheme: the protocol to be used on the connection.
      - user: the MySQL user name to be used on the connection.
      - dbUser: alias for user.
      - password: the password to be used on the connection.
      - dbPassword: same as password.
      - host: the hostname or IP address to be used on a TCP connection.
      - port: the port to be used in a TCP connection.
      - socket: the socket file name to be used on a connection through unix
        sockets.
      - schema: the schema to be selected once the connection is done.

      ATTENTION: The dbUser and dbPassword options are will be removed in a
                 future release.

      The connection options are case insensitive and can only be defined once.

      If an option is defined more than once, an error will be generated.

      For additional information on connection data use \? connection.

#@<OUT> mysqlx help
NAME
      mysqlx - Encloses the functions and classes available to interact with an
               X Protocol enabled MySQL Product.

DESCRIPTION
      The objects contained on this module provide a full API to interact with
      the different MySQL Products implementing the X Protocol.

      In the case of a MySQL Server the API will enable doing operations on the
      different database objects such as schema management operations and both
      table and collection management and CRUD operations. (CRUD: Create, Read,
      Update, Delete).

      Intention of the module is to provide a full API for development through
      scripting languages such as JavaScript and Python, this would be normally
      achieved through a normal session.

      To use the properties and functions available on this module you first
      need to import it.

      When running the shell in interactive mode, this module is automatically
      imported.

CONSTANTS
 - LockContention Row locking mode constants.
 - Type           Data type constants.

FUNCTIONS
      date_value(year, month, day[, hour, day, minute[, milliseconds]])
