#@<OUT> cluster.add_instance
NAME
      add_instance - Adds an Instance to the cluster.

SYNTAX
      <Cluster>.add_instance(instance[, options])

WHERE
      instance: An instance definition.
      options: Dictionary with options for the operation.

RETURNS
       nothing

DESCRIPTION
      This function adds an Instance to the default replica set of the cluster.

      The instance definition is the connection data for the instance.

      For additional information on connection data use \? connection.

      Only TCP/IP connections are allowed for this function.

      The options dictionary may contain the following attributes:

      - label: an identifier for the instance being added
      - password: the instance connection password
      - memberSslMode: SSL mode used on the instance
      - ipWhitelist: The list of hosts allowed to connect to the instance for
        group replication
      - localAddress: string value with the Group Replication local address to
        be used instead of the automatically generated one.
      - groupSeeds: string value with a comma-separated list of the Group
        Replication peer addresses to be used instead of the automatically
        generated one.

      The password may be contained on the instance definition, however, it can
      be overwritten if it is specified on the options.

      ATTENTION: The memberSslMode option will be removed in a future release.

      The memberSslMode option supports these values:

      - REQUIRED: if used, SSL (encryption) will be enabled for the instance to
        communicate with other members of the cluster
      - DISABLED: if used, SSL (encryption) will be disabled
      - AUTO: if used, SSL (encryption) will be automatically enabled or
        disabled based on the cluster configuration

      If memberSslMode is not specified AUTO will be used by default.

      The ipWhitelist format is a comma separated list of IP addresses or
      subnet CIDR notation, for example: 192.168.1.0/24,10.0.0.1. By default
      the value is set to AUTOMATIC, allowing addresses from the instance
      private network to be automatically set for the whitelist.

      The localAddress and groupSeeds are advanced options and their usage is
      discouraged since incorrect values can lead to Group Replication errors.

      The value for localAddress is used to set the Group Replication system
      variable 'group_replication_local_address'. The localAddress option
      accepts values in the format: 'host:port' or 'host:' or ':port'. If the
      specified value does not include a colon (:) and it is numeric, then it
      is assumed to be the port, otherwise it is considered to be the host.
      When the host is not specified, the default value is the host of the
      target instance specified as argument. When the port is not specified,
      the default value is the port of the target instance * 10 + 1. In case
      the automatically determined default port value is invalid (> 65535) then
      a random value in the range [1000, 65535] is used.

      The value for groupSeeds is used to set the Group Replication system
      variable 'group_replication_group_seeds'. The groupSeeds option accepts a
      comma-separated list of addresses in the format:
      'host1:port1,...,hostN:portN'.

EXCEPTIONS
      MetadataError in the following scenarios:

      - If the Metadata is inaccessible.
      - If the Metadata update operation failed.

      ArgumentError in the following scenarios:

      - If the instance parameter is empty.
      - If the instance definition is invalid.

      - reason: the reason for the state reported

      The state of the instance can be one of the following:

      - ok: if the instance transaction state is valid for the cluster
      - error: if the instance transaction state is not valid for the cluster

      The reason for the state reported can be one of the following:

      - new: if the instance doesnâ€™t have any transactions
      - recoverable:  if the instance executed GTIDs are not conflicting with
        the executed GTIDs of the cluster instances
      - diverged: if the instance executed GTIDs diverged with the executed
        GTIDs of the cluster instances
      - lost_transactions: if the instance has more executed GTIDs than the
        executed GTIDs of the cluster instances

      - If the Metadata update operation failed.

#@<OUT> cluster.force_quorum_using_partition_of
NAME
      force_quorum_using_partition_of - Restores the cluster from quorum loss.

SYNTAX
      <Cluster>.force_quorum_using_partition_of(instance[, password])

WHERE
      instance: An instance definition to derive the forced group from.
      password: String with the password for the connection.

RETURNS
       Nothing.

DESCRIPTION
      This function restores the cluster's default replicaset back into
      operational status from a loss of quorum scenario. Such a scenario can
      occur if a group is partitioned or more crashes than tolerable occur.

      The instance definition is the connection data for the instance.

        account.

      The password may be contained on the instance definition, however, it can
      be overwritten if it is specified on the options.

      Note that this operation is DANGEROUS as it can create a split-brain if
      incorrectly used and should be considered a last resort. Make absolutely
      sure that there are no partitions of this group that are still operating
      somewhere in the network, but not accessible from your location.

      When this function is used, all the members that are ONLINE from the
      point of view of the given instance definition will be added to the
      group.

EXCEPTIONS
      ArgumentError in the following scenarios:

      - If the instance parameter is empty.
      - If the instance definition cannot be used for Group Replication.

#@<OUT> cluster.remove_instance
NAME
      remove_instance - Removes an Instance from the cluster.

SYNTAX
      <Cluster>.remove_instance(instance[, options])

WHERE
      instance: An instance definition.
      options: Dictionary with options for the operation.

RETURNS
       Nothing.

DESCRIPTION
      This function removes an Instance from the default replicaSet of the
      cluster.

      The instance definition is the connection data for the instance.

      For additional information on connection data use \? connection.

      Only TCP/IP connections are allowed for this function.

      The options dictionary may contain the following attributes:

      - password: the instance connection password
      - force: boolean, indicating if the instance must be removed (even if
        only from metadata) in case it cannot be reached. By default, set to
        false.
      - interactive: boolean value used to disable the wizards in the command
        execution, i.e. prompts are not provided to the user and confirmation
        prompts are not shown.

      The password may be contained in the instance definition, however, it can
      be overwritten if it is specified on the options.

      The force option (set to true) must only be used to remove instances that
      are permanently not available (no longer reachable) or never to be reused
      again in a cluster. This allows to remove from the metadata an instance
      than can no longer be recovered. Otherwise, the instance must be brought
      back ONLINE and removed without the force option to avoid errors trying
      to add it back to a cluster.

EXCEPTIONS
