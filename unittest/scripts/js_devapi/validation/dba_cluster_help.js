DESCRIPTION

This function adds an Instance to the default replica set of the cluster.

The instance definition is the connection data for the instance.

The connection data may be specified in the following formats:

 - A URI string
 - A dictionary with the connection options

A basic URI string has the following format:

[scheme://][user[:password]@]host[:port][/schema][?option=value&option=value...]

The following options are valid for use either in a URI or in a dictionary:

 - ssl-mode: the SSL mode to be used in the connection.
 - ssl-ca: the path to the X509 certificate authority in PEM format.
 - ssl-capath: the path to the directory that contains the X509 certificates
   authorities in PEM format.
 - ssl-cert: The path to the X509 certificate in PEM format.
 - ssl-key: The path to the X509 key in PEM format.
 - ssl-crl: The path to file that contains certificate revocation lists.
 - ssl-crlpath: The path of directory that contains certificate revocation list
   files.
 - ssl-ciphers: List of permitted ciphers to use for connection encryption.
 - tls-version: List of protocols permitted for secure connections
 - auth-method: Authentication method

When these options are defined in a URI, their values must be URL encoded.

The following options are also valid when a dictionary is used:

 - scheme: the protocol to be used on the connection.
 - user: the MySQL user name to be used on the connection.
 - dbUser: alias for user.
 - password: the password to be used on the connection.
 - dbPassword: same as password.
 - host: the hostname or IP address to be used on a TCP connection.
 - port: the port to be used in a TCP connection.
 - socket: the socket file name to be used on a connection through unix
   sockets.
 - schema: the schema to be selected once the connection is done.

The connection options are case insensitive and can only be defined once.

If an option is defined more than once, an error will be generated.

For additional information on connection data use \? connection.

The options dictionary may contain the following attributes:

 - label: an identifier for the instance being added
 - password: the instance connection password
 - memberSslMode: SSL mode used on the instance
 - ipWhitelist: The list of hosts allowed to connect to the instance for group
   replication

The password may be contained on the instance definition, however, it can be
overwritten if it is specified on the options.

The memberSslMode option supports these values:

 - REQUIRED: if used, SSL (encryption) will be enabled for the instance to
   communicate with other members of the cluster
 - DISABLED: if used, SSL (encryption) will be disabled
 - AUTO: if used, SSL (encryption) will be automatically enabled or disabled
   based on the cluster configuration

If memberSslMode is not specified AUTO will be used by default.

The ipWhitelist format is a comma separated list of IP addresses or subnet CIDR
notation, for example: 192.168.1.0/24,10.0.0.1. By default the value is set to
AUTOMATIC, allowing addresses from the instance private network to be
automatically set for the whitelist.

For additional information on connection data use \? connection.

The options dictionary may contain the following options:

 - mycnfPath: The path of the MySQL configuration file for the instance.
 - password: The password to get connected to the instance.
 - clusterAdmin: The name of the InnoDB cluster administrator user.
 - clusterAdminPassword: The password for the InnoDB cluster administrator
   account.

The password may be contained on the instance definition, however, it can be
overwritten if it is specified on the options.

Note that this operation is DANGEROUS as it can create a split-brain if
incorrectly used and should be considered a last resort. Make absolutely sure
that there are no partitions of this group that are still operating somewhere
in the network, but not accessible from your location.

When this function is used, all the members that are ONLINE from the point of
view of the given instance definition will be added to the group.

The connection options are case insensitive and can only be defined once.

If an option is defined more than once, an error will be generated.

For additional information on connection data use \? connection.

The options dictionary may contain the following attributes:

 - password/dbPassword: the instance connection password
 - force: boolean, indicating if the instance must be removed (even if only
   from metadata) in case it cannot be reached. By default, set to false.

The password may be contained in the instance definition, however, it can be
overwritten if it is specified on the options.

The force option (set to true) must only be used to remove instances that are
permanently not available (no longer reachable) or never to be reused again in
a cluster. This allows to remove from the metadata an instance than can no
longer be recovered. Otherwise, the instance must be brought back ONLINE and
removed without the force option to avoid errors trying to add it back to a
cluster.
